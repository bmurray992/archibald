- HTTP client for Council API interactions
- Message handlers for meeting protocol
- Memory synchronization capabilities

### 3. Example Integration (Python)
```python
import httpx
import websockets
from datetime import datetime

class CouncilMember:
    def __init__(self, member_id, name, role, capabilities):
        self.member_id = member_id
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        self.council_endpoint = "http://archie.local:8090"
        
    async def register_with_council(self):
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(
                f"{self.council_endpoint}/api/council/members/register",
                json={
                    "member_id": self.member_id,

                    "capabilities": self.capabilities,
                    "endpoint_url": self.get_endpoint_url(),
                    "public_key": self.get_public_key()
                }
            )
            return response.json()
    
    async def summon_meeting(self, topic, context):
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            response = await client.post(
                f"{self.council_endpoint}/api/council/meetings/summon",
                json={
